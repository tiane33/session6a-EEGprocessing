    "After examining your data, the first thing researchers often do is filter them based on what kind of analysis you want to do. A filter removes or attenuates parts of a signal. Usually, filters act on specific frequency ranges of a signal — for example, suppressing all frequency components above or below a certain cutoff value. For an ERP and time-frequency analysis, you would normally want to get rid of very high (e.g., above 100Hz) and very low (e.g., below 0.1 Hz) frequencies. It is important to also remove power line noise (e.g., 50Hz or 60Hz and their harmonics).\n",

    "Event dictionaries like this one are used when extracting epochs from continuous data; the / character in the dictionary keys allows pooling across conditions by requesting partial condition descriptors (i.e., requesting 'auditory' will select all epochs with Event IDs 1 and 2; requesting 'left' will select all epochs with Event IDs 1 and 3). An example of this is shown in the next section. There is also a convenient plot_events function for visualizing the distribution of events across the duration of the recording (to make sure event detection worked as expected). Here we’ll also make use of the Info attribute to get the sampling frequency of the recording (so our x-axis will be in seconds instead of in samples)."
